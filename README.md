Fuel Efficiency Analysis and Factors:

Project Goal: Understand which factors most significantly influence a car's fuel efficiency (MPG).
Real-World Relevance: Consumers and policymakers are interested in improving fuel efficiency to reduce fuel costs and emissions.
Analysis Steps:
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values (if any).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize the distribution of MPG using histograms and box plots.
Create scatter plots to explore the relationship between MPG and other numerical variables (cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration).
Use box plots to compare MPG across different categories (cylinders, origin, model_year).
Create a correlation matrix to see the corelation between the numerical data.
Insights:
Identify which variables have a strong negative or positive correlation with MPG.
Determine if certain origins or model years tend to have higher MPG.
Solutions/Recommendations:
Present findings in a simple report or presentation.
Suggest that manufacturers focus on reducing weight and displacement to improve MPG.
Indicate what years and origins have the best mpg.
